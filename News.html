		<b>It is a great news for Chinese soccer fans and WuLei. He is the sixth Chinese player that'll attend the UEFA Europa League. WuLei is the first Chinese player ever in the history that brings his teams to the UEFA Europe League by himself. Espanyol, from the original relagation edge of the Esanyol to reach the Europa League today. This is the charm of football, how crazy! Hope to see more wonderful pictures of WuLei's goal in the Europa League next season!</b>
